# [paste](https://paste.xpple.dev/)
A base64 backed pastebin which stores its data in the URL. This assures the content of the paste is never lost; if 
this site goes down, the data will still be retrievable through the URL. With simplicity in mind, this pastebin is 
perfect to quickly share data with others.
